This project introduces an advanced **chess-playing robotic arm system**, which leverages distributed architecture, intelligent decision-making, and precise control techniques.

## Project Highlights

- Designed and implemented a QARM four-axis robotic arm system to enable **human-robot chess interaction** and **drawing tasks**.
- Developed control and decision systems integrating multiple platforms:  
  - **MATLAB** for workspace simulation and initialization.  
  - **Simulink** for robot control logic, inverse kinematics, and sequence logic design.  
  - **Visual Studio** for decision-making algorithms utilizing a pre-trained chess AI.
- Applied **plane fitting algorithms** to correct robotic arm positional errors, ensuring sub-millimeter precision.  
- Innovated a **magnet-assisted gripper** and a passive leveling tool to handle under-actuated placement challenges.

## Data Visualization

### Chess Movement Visualization

To visualize the robot's movements and decisions, the following dynamic plot demonstrates a game's progress.

Save your JSON data (e.g., `robot-moves.json`) and render with Hugo's shortcode:

```go
{{</* chart data="robot-moves" */>}}
```

### Robot Simulation Data: Plane Fitting

Using **MATLAB** and **Simulink**, the plane fitting data can be rendered interactively. Below is the raw fitted trajectory data:

```csv
x,y,z
0,0,0
10,20,15
20,40,30
...
```

Render the table in your page:

```go
{{</* table path="fitted-plane.csv" header="true" caption="Fitted Plane Data for Robotic Arm Correction" */>}}
```

## Challenges and Innovations

### Key Challenges:
1. **Precision Issues**:  
   Initial central alignment strategies led to XY and Z errors due to under-actuation.  
   Solution: Plane fitting using calibration points and fitted matrix algorithms.
2. **Magnet Control**:  
   Balanced magnetic forces between chess pieces and the board, ensuring stable pickup and release.
3. **Integration Limitations**:  
   Bridged communication challenges between **MATLAB**, **Visual Studio**, and **Simulink** using **TCP/IP communication**ï¼ŒCSV files and memory-based data sharing.

### Innovations:
- **Passive Adaptive Gripper**: Maintains a horizontal placement for under-actuated end-effectors via gravity-driven rotation.
- **Distributed System Architecture**: Partitioned decision-making, control, and vision across three independent modules for enhanced scalability.
