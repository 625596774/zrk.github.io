## Challenges and Innovations

### Key Challenges:
1. **Precision Issues**:  
   Initial central alignment strategies led to XY and Z errors due to under-actuation.  
   Solution: Plane fitting using calibration points and fitted matrix algorithms.
2. **Magnet Control**:  
   Balanced magnetic forces between chess pieces and the board, ensuring stable pickup and release.
3. **Integration Limitations**:  
   Bridged communication challenges between **MATLAB**, **Visual Studio**, and **Simulink** using **TCP/IP communication**ï¼ŒCSV files and memory-based data sharing.

### Innovations:
- **Passive Adaptive Gripper**: Maintains a horizontal placement for under-actuated end-effectors via gravity-driven rotation.
- **Distributed System Architecture**: Partitioned decision-making, control, and vision across three independent modules for enhanced scalability.
