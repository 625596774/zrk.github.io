## Project Highlights

- **Line-Tracing Task**: 
  - Leveraged OpenMV for image-based navigation along pre-defined tracks, using **dynamic thresholding** for accurate path detection.
  - Developed PID-based speed control to maintain stability on sharp turns and narrow paths.

- **Obstacle-Avoidance Task**: 
  - Implemented a hybrid algorithm using **ultrasonic sensors** and IMU data to detect and bypass obstacles while navigating toward the destination.
  - Used precise wall-following techniques to avoid getting trapped in loops during obstacle avoidance.

- **Object Grasping Integration**: 
  - Designed a lightweight, adaptive gripper driven by SG90 servos, ensuring stability during transport.
  - Integrated grasping and placing processes seamlessly into both line-tracing and obstacle-avoidance tasks.

## Hardware Design

- Constructed a two-layered chassis using 3D printing for efficient weight distribution, ensuring lightness and stability.
- Adopted **two-wheel differential drive** for high maneuverability, supported by a rear omni-wheel for balance.
- Integrated sensors (ultrasonic, IMU, OpenMV) with strategic placements for optimal data collection and processing.
